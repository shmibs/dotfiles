##Current Utilities

###MATE
i'm using mate as a backend to handle all
that dconf garbage etc. apart from a few
daemons, everything is launched from
mate-session

###herbstluftwm
i was using awesome for a while, but dealing with all
that lua got annoying. herbstluftwm has the really
interesting concept of allowing manual tiling of frames
and then providing automatic layouts for inside the
frames. in theory, it's the best of both worlds, but
gets kind of confusing, so i've just set the layout
to always be max so frames basically just have multiple
tabs for me that can by cycled through. it's really
neat for saving screen space! (try splitting a screen
with both an editor and a terminal on one side and
all your documentation on the other)

###urxvt
yay for mouseless copy-pasta!
if you've never seend it, check out
[urxvt-perls](https://github.com/muennich/urxvt-perls).

###ranger
yay for everything about ranger!

###sxiv
were it not for being completely cut off from any
file management, sxiv would be the best thing to
ever happen to images. i've been looking into
adding a feature of some sort for it to communicate
selections to the outside world.

###pentadactyl
if you've never heard of it, try pentadactyl NOW.
suddenly a browser is no longer a thing that necessarily
breaks your workflow when you have to refer to it for
information. oh, and try [setting your hint keys](http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/faq#faq-hintkeys).

###dunst/dmenu/trayer/compton/bar/nitrogen
useful things all around. i'm still trying to figure out
alternative mouse buttons with bar.
