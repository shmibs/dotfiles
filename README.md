##Current Utilities

###MATE

i'm using mate as a backend to handle all that dconf garbage etc. apart from a
few daemons, everything is launched from mate-session

###herbstluftwm

herbstluftwm has the really interesting concept of allowing manual tiling of
frames and then providing automatic layouts for inside those frames. in theory,
it's the best of both worlds, but it gets kind of confusing, so i've just set
the layout to always be max. this way frames basically just have multiple tabs
for me that can by cycled through. it's really neat for saving screen space!
(try splitting a screen with both an editor and a terminal on one side and all
your documentation on the other). i3 can do much the same thing, but it comes
with lots of slightly annoying things to get rid of.
